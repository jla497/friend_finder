# friend_finder

You can test the web app in my website:

https://jaesportfolio.com/projects/login.php

1. Create a mock user account to login.
2. Add me as your friend.
3. You can then view my previous geolocation on google map.
4. Search for places nearby you.
5. Click on one of those places and you will receive a direction service from your current location.
